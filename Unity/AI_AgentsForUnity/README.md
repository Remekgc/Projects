# AI Agents for Unity:

This project contains examples of how AI agents can work in Unity using several AI behavior algorithms and Vector math used for AI navigation.


Algorithms used for the AI behaviour:
    GOAP - Goal Oriented Action Planning.
    BT - Behaviour Trees.
    FSM - Finite State Machines.
